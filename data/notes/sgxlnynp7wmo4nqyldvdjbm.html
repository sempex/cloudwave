<p>The center of our Infrastructure should be a Node JS API running some backend framework. When a specific route is called ("/deploy") the backend should check if a git URL was supplied and the framework type was also present in a separate field. </p>
<p>It should then start a dagger pipeline for the framework given, that fetches the repo, builds a container for it and stores it in a local registry. If possible it could then also deploy the container to a k0s cluster. But this could also be handled separately with the k0s SDK. </p>
<p>Later this could be expanted with seceret management and so on.</p>
