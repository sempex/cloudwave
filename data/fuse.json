When a specific route is called (\"/deploy\") the backend should check if a git URL was supplied and the framework type was also present in a separate field. \n\nIt should then start a dagger pipeline for the framework given, that fetches the repo, builds a container for it and stores it in a local registry. If possible it could then also deploy the container to a k0s cluster. But this could also be handled separately with the k0s SDK. \n\nLater this could be expanted with seceret management and so on.\n\n# Components\n## Build Images\nIt is important to safly build the images in an isolated env\n- https://github.com/genuinetools/img\n\n## Store and cache images\nRight now im unsure how this is going to work\n- https://docs.docker.com/registry/deploying/\n\n","n":0.086}}}]}
