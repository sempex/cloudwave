## SSL

A user is allowed to get 50 certificates per week (1 week = 7 days) per domain.

It is possible to request the exact same certificate 5 time per week. Shiper cashes certificates in the project namespace. So this limit is only hit if a user deletes and recreates a project with the same domain set 5 times per week. This is not a realistic scenario.
